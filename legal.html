                            you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. 
                            You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our 
                            trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of 
                            the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or 
                            make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,

                        <li>
                            Manentia Advisory is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient 
                                as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to 
                                charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you 
                                for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re 
                                paying for.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Manentia Advisory app stores and processes personal data that you have 
                            provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your 
                            phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not 
                            jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions 
                            and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could 
                            make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise 
                            your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Manentia Advisory app 
                            won’t work properly or at all.</li>
                        <li>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</li>
                        <li>Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app
                            Google Play Services (Link: https://policies.google.com/terms)</li>
                        <li>You should be aware that there are certain things that Manentia Advisory will not 
                            take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an 
                            active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your 
                            mobile network provider, but Manentia Advisory cannot take responsibility for the 
                            app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you 
                            don’t have any of your data allowance left.</li>
                        <li>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that 
                            your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As 
                            a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the 
                            duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In 
                            using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including 
                            roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region 
                            or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the 
                            device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you 
                            have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</li>
                        <li>Along the same lines, Manentia Advisory cannot always take responsibility for the 
                            way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if 
                            it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Manentia 
                            Advisory cannot accept responsibility.</li>
                        <li>With respect to Manentia Advisory’s responsibility for your use of the app, when 
                            you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to 
                            ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to 
                            provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Manentia 
                            Advisory accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a 
                            result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</li>
                        <li>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on 
                            Android – the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide 
                            to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download 
                            the updates if you want to keep using the app. Manentia Advisory does not promise 
                            that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the 
                            Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to 
                            always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish 
                            to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving 
                            notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, 
                            (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop 
                            using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
